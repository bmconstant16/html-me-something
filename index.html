<h2>Where it all started: Virginia, United States</h2>
<p class= beginning>This is where it all started in 1987. I grew up in a small town in about 2 hours southwest of Washington, DC. I'm not sure when it started, but I've always had an interest in hearing stories from other parts of the world. We had great family vacations when I was young, but I didn't board my first plane overseas until I was 20! This is my sister and I taking a Christmas photo at Sears, growing up in the early 90s. We've both seen a lot of the world since this photo and the world feels smaller! 	&#9829 </p>

<h2>United Kingdom</h2>
<h3>Summer 2007</h3>
<p>I went to Christopher Newport University where I was selected to travel to Oxford University, along with some incredibly talented classmates. We spent two weeks here studying at the Bodleian library, hearing from Oxford scholars, eating Harry Potter-style dinners in King's College, punting along River Cherwell, and playing around in London. We figured out how to use the British &pound instead of the US &#36 by trying out different pubs. I made some lasting friendships on this trip and nearly 10 years later, I'm so proud of everything this group has gone on to achieve in their lives. On this trip, I also went to France and saw the Eiffel tower for the first time and then visited Scotland where I saw fields more green than anything I'd seen at home. I also tried haggis and scotch for the first time! </p>

<h2>India</h2>
<h3>Winter 2008</h3>
<p>In 2006, I went to India to study NGO outreach as part of an intercultural leadership studies course. We met with NGO's working on children's education and health. Although just there for ten days we visited India's Golden Triangle: New Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur. The history and architecture was humbling. It was one of the first moments I experienced culture shock in large part because of the large number of people in such a big city. I had never experienced or observed the kind of poverty I saw in India and it continues to drive a lot of my altruistic efforts today. I also learned a lot here about traveling safely, being flexible with planning, and how to stay healthy while traveling. I loved Indian food before I went, and I loved it even more after I left. </p>

<h2>Czech Republic</h2>
<h3>Fall 2008</h3>
<p>In 2008, I went to the Prague in the Czech Republic for a semester to study abroad. It was in the fall and I loved having a bit of summer and winter. One of my favorite places to visit is the Prague Castle, in the background of this photo. We studied Slavic history and culture through the lens of religion, philosophy, and architecture. I also took classes in Czech language and fell in love with one of my favorite artists, Alfons Mucha. Everything I learned here about Eastern Europe was so interesting and I felt humbled once again learning about the Velvet Revolution &#42 that happened on November 1989 when students organized a peaceful protest to remember International students Day. The protest ended in violence and effectively ended the Communist Party's Rule in Prague, just months after the fall of the Berlin wall. While in Prague, my classmates and I traveled to Germany, Slovenia, Italy, and Greece. This is one of my favorite places in the world! </p>

<h2>Spain</h2>
<h3>Summer 2010</h3>
<p>After I graduated from my bachelor's program, I took a month off to trek the Camino de Santiago in Spain. I started in the south of France at St. Jean de Pied de Port and walked 555 km to Galicia along the way of St james. It was a jubilee year when the 25th of July, the Feast of St James, falls on a Sunday. I met so many wonderful people from all over the world</p>

<h2>Thailand 2014</h2>
<h3>Winter 2014 to Spring 2018</h3>
<p>In 2014, my best friend/husband and I packed up our bags and moved from Virginia to Thailand. We lived here for 4 wonderful, exciting years. While here, the world definitely really got a lot smaller. We love Southeast Asia and made every effort to learn about the history, politics, and languages of Thailand as well as other neighboring countries. Because Bangkok is a travel hub for much of Asia, we traveled quite a bit while living here. In Thailand, we visited the beautiful beaches of Thailand where we learned how to dive; we traveled to Northern Thailand and stayed with hilltribes where we cooked dinner together and slept in bamboo huts; we took the train to the River Kwai and walked through the famous Hellfire pass where allied forces were captured by the Japanese and made to work on cutting a rail pass through the dense mountains along the Thai/Burma border during World War 2; and rode bikes in Ayutta where the capital of Siam was in 1378. There were so many wonderful friends we made and experiences we had here that we'll never forget.</p>

<h2>New Zealand</h2>
<h3>Summer 2014</h3>
<p>One of our first trips we took was to New Zealand. NZ is made up of two islands- the north and south. We started in Wellington at the south of the north island, then took a ferry to the southern island and drove a counterclockwise circle around the island. It wasn't enough time! We still think fondly of the beauty of the mountains, the fjords, the wildlife, and the kindness of the people. </p>

<h2>Laos</h2>
<h3>Summer 2016</h3>
<p>Laos is a small country to the northeast of Thailand. Not a lot of people know about Laos, but it's a beautiful country with an incredible history- both ancient and recent. Many people may remember its role in the Vietnam War when it was bombed in order to combat fleeing Vietnamese military leaders. Today, Laos remains a beautiful country and is a wonderful place to see the mighty Mekhong river. While here we visited the capital of Vientiane and the UNESCO world heritage site of LuanPrabang. We also spent three days walking through the Laos countryside with a local Laotian who took us to hill tribe villages where we helped cook and shared meals with locals. We walked through farmland, by waterfalls, and incredible kharst limestone peaks.</p>

<h2>Indonesia</h2>
<h3>Summer 2016</h3>
<p>Indonesia is one of our favorite places to visit- the country is packed with beauty across is hundreds of islands. We visited three times (twice to Bali) and still have more we wanted to see and learn about. We visited Bali, probably one of the most famous island in Indonesia for its beaches, hiked up Mt Batur there, and also went to the island of Java where we visited Mt Bromo and Iljen Crater. Indonesia has some of the most active volcanoes in the world. I've never been more terrified of mother nature than standing on the crater of an active volcano- it hadn't erupted recently, but you could hear and feel the rumble of the ground. </p>

<p id=second>One of the most impressive places in Iljen Crater, where sulfur deposits come out of the ground because of the gasses trapped underneath. It's one of only two places like it in the world. Here we are at Iljen crater after waking up at 2am to trek to see the 'blue' sulfur flames. The chemicals and sediment make these crater lakes bright blue. We loved our tour guide and still keep in touch with him!</p>

<h2>Bali</h2>
<h3>Summer 2016</h3>
<p>We've been to Bali twice, but we spent a good deal of time there with our dear friend. We spent 2 days in the mountainous inner region of the island called Ubud and spent our days hiking through rice fields and walked to the top of an active volcano, Mt Batur. Then, we travelled to the beaches of Seminyak, one of the famous beaches in Bali. My husband stayed behind and extra day and hiked to the top of another active volcano called Mt. Agung. We stayed in a very nice hotel the last nice of our visit and swam in the pool, walked around the nearby handcrafted shops, played in the ocean, and enjoyed each other's company. The second time we went was a quick visit as we went on to Java, another large island in Indonesia.</p>

<h2>Malaysia</h2>
<h3>Summer 2016</h3>
<p>Although I went to Kuala Lumpur and loved the beautiful architecture, our favorite places in Malaysia is Borneo. Three countries occupy Borneo: Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia. We stayed on the Malaysian side and trekked Mt Kinabalu. Afterwards, we visited Mulu National Park where we saw some incredible wildlife we'd only ever seen in zoos, went caving, and walked to see the famous pinnacles of Mulu. I'd never had a leech on me before, but in a rainforest, you can expect it! </p>

<h2>Nepal</h2>
<h3>Fall 2017</h3>
<p>Nepal was a lifelong dream for me- I wanted to hike the Annapurna circuit over three weeks. We planned our trip to arrive in Kathmandu, then on we walked over the next 18 days through the beautiful Himalayas. We started on the circuit and made our way up to Thorong La Pass, which is 5416 meters high- that's higher than Mt Everest base camp! I have never had such a hard time walking, and I don't think I've ever been so cold! After the pass, we dropped into the Mustang region of Nepal, with brown peaks. Afterwards we took a bus and then cut north once again as we trekked to Annapurna base camp.  </p>

<h2>Japan</h2>
<h3>Fall 2016, Fall 2017, Summer 2018</h3>
<p>We went to Japan... three times!!! My husband went 4 times, one additional trip to Kyoto he loved it so much! We love this country and the culture of this place so much. The first time we went to Tokyo, Kyoto, and a place called Kamikochi. It's a mountainous region along a volcano chain- we went for the beautiful hikes. It was fall, so the leaves were changing and there were so many apple-flavored foods! I enjoyed visiting my first Japanese onsen. The second time, we travelled straight to Mt Fuji and hiked up to the top of the mountain over two days. We collected wood burning stamps on our hiking sticks at each hut along the way. Then, we travelled by high speed train to Hokkaido where we rented a car and drove to Asahidake where we spent the next 4 days hiking and enjoying the hot springs from the volcanic mountains. We also visited these beautiful flower fields here known for the bright beautiful blooms. One of our favorite memories is trying to order tepanyaki despite knowing zero Japanese. We made do with a lonely planet guide, smiles, and hand gestures with our Japanese hosts. We also learned about the Ainu people, the native Japanese ancestors in this part of the country. The third time, I went with two friends to Tokyo and Yokohama. We visited temples and ate a bunch of delicious sushi. We love Japanese foods and are constantly on a search for excellent ramen wherever we go.</p>

<h2>Italy 2018</h2>
<h3>Fall 2008, Winter 2018</h3>
<p>I traveled to Italy during my study abroad in Prague- we went to Trieste in northern Italy, as well as Florence, Venice, and Rome. When I went back in 2018, we visited another dear friend living in Rome, then traveled to Venice, Florence, and Milan on our way to Switzerland. It was my husband's first time in Italy that time, so we had to go back to a few places to visit. His favorite place was Venice. It also helped that this time, we had a friend who knew all the hidden spots since living there. I found my new favorite food: Cacio e pepe. It's cheese and black pepper over pasta- an upscale mac and cheese maybe? But, it tastes amazing. </p>

<h2>Romania</h2>
<h3>Winter 2017 and Summer 2019</h3>
<p>I've visited Romania twice. There's something magical and mystical about Romania. The first time we visited was around Christmas, so there were Christmas markets with warm wine and cozy outdoor fires. There are so many beautiful castles in Romania. We visited the towns of Sibiu, Sigisoara, and Brasov. Yes, we visited Dracula's castles, but it wasn't my favorite! Peles Castle was, and that's pictured below. It was absolutely charming and the stuff of fairytales. The second time I visited was to present my Master's <a hred="https://destinationunknown.io/app/welcome">work</a> at the annual Free and Open Source Software 4 Geospatial Conference held in Bucharest. While in Bucharest, I tried a lot of traditional Romanian food and enjoyed spending time with Romanian students and  software developers from around the world working in the GIS world.</p>

<h2>South Korea</h2>
<h3>Fall 2016</h3>
<p>We visited Korea over Thanksgiving break for a long weekend and we loved it. We stayed in a cute traditional Korean house, visited temples, saw a parade, and tried a lot of Korea food. We tried Korean BBQ, Makgeolli (a fermented rice drink that's actually pretty good), teas, fried chicken, local batch beer, black chicken ginseng soup, and so much more. </p>

<a name="switzerland"></a>
<h2>Switzerland</h2>
<h3>Winter 2018 and Summer 2020</h3>
<p>I am so blessed to say I've been to Switzerland TWICE. The first time we went to Zermatt for three nights in winter. It was so cozy and covered with heaps of beautiful snow. I'm not a strong skier, so we didn't ski... we vowed to come back in the summer for some long hikes. In the summer, we went back to Zermatt and did a 4-day hut to hut trek in the mountains and ate so much delicious food, just drenched in beautiful sunlight shining down on the mountains. We then traveled by train to Interlaken where we spent 5 days walking from hut to hut in towns from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen to Grindelwald to Faulhorn. These were long days with lots of elevation change, but we were grateful to be using our legs soaking up the views of the Eiger, Monch, Jungfrau, as well as the two big lakes that give Interlaken its name.</p>

<h2>Portugal 2020</h2>
<h3>Spring 2020</h3>
<p>I visited Portugal with two of my dear friends for a week. We visited Lisbon and Porto where we learned about the history of Portugal, touched the north sea, ate a million great pastries, and tasted Port wine. The following week I walked 60 miles from Porto to Viano do Castelo along the Camino Portug<&#233>s.</p>
